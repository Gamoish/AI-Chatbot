🤖 AI Multi-Chatbot Discord Bot
A smart Discord bot that dynamically routes your queries to the most suitable AI chatbot—OpenAI, Gemini, or Claude—based on context and intent.

🔍 Overview
This bot acts as an intelligent AI router, analyzing user input on a Discord server and directing it to the best-fit chatbot for that specific request. Whether it's code help, creative writing, general Q&A, or technical support—this bot figures out which AI is best suited to answer and delivers accurate, fast responses.

⚡ Features
✨ Multi-AI Integration: Connects seamlessly with:

OpenAI (GPT models) – ideal for creative tasks, reasoning, and general conversation

Gemini (Google) – great for research-oriented and factual responses

Claude (Anthropic) – excels at summarization, comprehension, and safe dialogue

🧠 Intelligent Query Routing: Uses natural language understanding (NLU) to interpret the query and choose the most appropriate AI model.

💬 Discord Command Support: Easy-to-use commands to interact with the bot directly in Discord.

🔧 Modular Design: Easily extendable to support more AI services or custom routing logic.

🪄 Open Source: Customize, contribute, or deploy your own version.

🛠️ Setup & Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-multibot-discord.git
cd ai-multibot-discord
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following:

env
Copy
Edit
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_key
4. Run the Bot
bash
Copy
Edit
python bot.py
🚀 Usage
Once the bot is online in your server, you can start chatting!

Example:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
User: How do I center a div in CSS?
Bot: (routes to OpenAI) Here’s how you can center a div...
No need for special commands—the bot automatically determines which AI to use.

🧠 How the Router Works
Input Analysis: When a message is received, the bot analyzes it using a set of rules, heuristics, or optionally an intent classification model.

Routing Logic: Based on the analysis, the bot selects:

OpenAI → Creative writing, coding help, casual conversation

Gemini → Research queries, factual questions

Claude → Ethical dialogue, summarization, comprehension

Response Delivery: The selected model processes the input and sends the result back to Discord.
